## Hello World! C Program
`main.c` file
```c
// 1. This line is a comment that is ignored by compiler.

// 2. include standard library for input/output. Allows to print to shell
#include <stdio.h> 

// 3. execution start inside this **function** named main. 
int main() 
{ // start of main function

    // 4. prints to the shell
    printf("Hello, world\n");
    return 0; /* 5. returns integer 0 */

} // end of main function
```

---

## Running the Program

1. Run gcc compiler to get executable file `main`
```gcc main.c -o main```
2. Run the executable `main`
```./main```

## Using Makefile to do it together

1. Create a file `Makefile`
```make
// Makefile
run: 
    gcc main.c -o main
    ./main
```
2. run `make run`
